## For simulating the reverse parking process
### The specific type of Reeds-Shepp algorithm, named SCS

#### Concept
In the Reeds-Shepp algorithm, the vehicle's turning radius is set to a `fixed value`, typically the vehicle's `minimum turning radius`

`SCS` type means straight-curve-straight process

Some elements like `car`, `garage` are defined in the `simulation_element.py`

```shell
python path_planning_for_reversing.py
```
